# Chat2D

## Introduction

Chat2D is an innovative AI chat tool designed to help users organize and expand their ideas in a nonlinear way through graphical thinking. The main difference from traditional AI chat tools is that Chat2D treats each conversation with AI as an independent node and presents it graphically.

## Core Features

- **Nonlinear Dialogue**: The transformation from one dimension to two dimensions breaks the time linearity constraint in traditional chat applications. Users can freely switch between multiple dialogue topics, making the thinking process more flexible.

- **Visualization of Chat Thinking Process**: Through a graphical interface, users can intuitively view and manage their thinking process. This visualization makes it easier for users to understand the evolution of their thoughts and effectively discover new connections and associations.

- **Token Saving**: Reduce unnecessary information transmission through precise questioning, improving efficiency and reducing costs. Users can make more precise inquiries about specific content, thereby reducing the transmission of irrelevant information.

- **Diverse Thinking Modes**: Users can expand different thoughts and ideas into multiple nodes, with each node exploring different questions. This diverse thinking approach can spark more creativity and enhance problem-solving capabilities.

## How to Use

1. Start the application and enter your first question
2. View the generated thought nodes, select text for follow-up questions
3. Use graphical tools to expand and merge nodes, managing your thought process
